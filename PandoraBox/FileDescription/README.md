## FileDescription Project

**Objective:** Change the Description Of Executable Applications (exe)<br />
**Description:** This Project let us change Executables (exe) File Description like: 'COPYRIGTHS,FILE DESCRIPTION,VERSION,etc'.<br />
**Remark:** 'FileDescriptionchanger.bat' script it will use 'verpatch.exe' and 'resource.rc' to acomplish that.

<br /> 

### How To:
- 1ยบ Execute 'FileDescriptionchanger.bat' script and follow the instructions (User Inputs).<br />
  - **{ The 'transformed.exe' File will be saved in working directory and ready to be used }** ..<br />
    - Edit File 'Properties' -> 'Details' to make sure the values have been correct changed.<br />

<br />

### Limitations:
1ยบ **'verpatch.exe'** will not work in **'wine'** under Linux Distros (only under Windows systems).<br />
2ยบ IF you use **'FileDescription.bat'** in a Legit Apllication, that binary file will be changed.<br />
**{ So its adviced to 'COPY' the File to be transformed to a new location to leave the Legit application intact }**<br />
3ยบ Sometimes Anti-Virus solluctions will ask us if we want to send the 'temp' file for analyzes (offcourse not)<br />
**{ So Remmenber to turn off Windows Defender 'automatic sample submission' from sending samples to Microsoft }**
